```
npm i
```

to install all the required libraries.

3. Change the ".env.example" file to ".env" and enter the various variables (if needed). Delete all variables which are not needed.
   Default values for various variables, used in the project, can be found under config->default.json.

4. After configuring the server (as portrayed above), you can do:

```
npm run dev
```

for development purposes,

```
npm run start
```

for production.

- IMPORTANT! mongoDB is used as the database. You MUST installed it locally or have an Atlas DB account.

### Seeding the DB

For seeding the DB with 11 products, 5 categories and 2 users (regular,admin) and their carts.

```
npm run seed-db
```

1. The seeding process is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Without it there will be no categories and no Admin user.
1. The seeding process empties all collections (products,categories,users) before inserting the data.
1. The seeded data can be changed in scripts->dbSeederData.

- Images are saved in "public/uploads".
- The server has a logger feature, which saves request errors (status 400 and above), to dated files located in the "logs" folder.
- The server implements a login blocker, which limits failed tries to 3, and then blocks the IP for 24 hours. The list of blocked IPs is stored locally in the "logInMW.js" middleware.
- The server limits requests to 1000/24 Hours. These configurations can be found in the "limiterMW" middleware.
- The server uses the "nodemailer" library to send emails. To work properly, the library params should be configured in the .env file.
- The server has a "Forgot Password" functionality. It generates a temporary token (json web token), which is valid for 5 minutes, and sends the user an email with a link to "Reset Password" Page with the token as a param.

## Final Notes:

There is no doubt that this project can be further developed and improved (and maybe it will). If you wish to do so - be my guest 😊

## ENJOY!!
